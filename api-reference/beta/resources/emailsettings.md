# emailSettings resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Defines the settings for emails sent from Lifecycle workflow [tasks](identitygovernance-task.md). Allows you to use a verified custom [domain](domain.md) and [organizationalBranding](organizationalbranding.md) with emails sent out via workflow tasks.

## Properties

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|senderDomain|String|Specifies the [domain](domain.md) that should be used when sending email notifications. This domain must be [verified](../api/domain-verify.md) in order to be used.|
|useCompanyBranding|Boolean|Specifies if the organization’s banner logo should be included in email notifications. The banner logo will replace the Microsoft logo at the top of the email notification. If `true` the banner logo will be taken from the tenant’s [branding settings](organizationalbranding.md). This value can only be set to `true` if the [organizationalBranding](organizationalbranding.md) **bannerLogo** property is set. |
