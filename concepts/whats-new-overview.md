# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

## March 2023: New in preview only

### Files
When [sharing an item on OneDrive for Business](/graph/api/driveitem-createlink?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) with other users, include the option to notify those users by email.

### Sites and lists
When [sharing an item on SharePoint](/graph/api/listitem-createlink?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) with other users, include the option to notify those users by email.

## February 2023: New and generally available

### Identity and access | Directory management
- Following the Zero Trust cybersecurity model, Microsoft partners can use [granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP)](/graph/api/resources/delegatedadminrelationships-api-overview) to carry out administrative tasks with least-privileged access to their customer tenants, to avoid potential security exposures. Instead of requesting Global Administrator role as in the past, partners request specific roles for customer tenant administration for a definite amount of time, and their customers must explicitly grant the least-privileged access to them.
- [Get](/graph/api/onpremisesdirectorysynchronization-get) or [update](/graph/api/onpremisesdirectorysynchronization-update) the configuration and features of [on-premises directory synchronization](/graph/api/resources/onpremisesdirectorysynchronization) set up for an organization, including [configuration to prevent accidental deletion](/graph/api/resources/onPremisesAccidentalDeletionPrevention).

### Identity and access | Governance
As part of a [policy for access package assignment](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy), you can specify or get the required regex pattern for a requestor to answer an [access package question](/graph/api/resources/accesspackagequestion).

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
Specify in a [cross-tenant access policy](/graph/api/resources/crosstenantaccesspolicy) to enable B2B collaboration across Azure clouds, for example, between tenants in Azure Commercial and Azure Government clouds, and between Azure Commercial and Azure China clouds.

### Search | Query
Use application permissions and [search all shared or private content on SharePoint sites](search-concept-searchall.md) that belong to the app owner in a specified region. 

### Security | Attack simulation and training
- [Get](/graph/api/simulationautomation-get) information about an [automated attack simulation](/graph/api/resources/simulationautomation) for a tenant.
- [Get a list](/graph/api/simulationautomation-list-runs) of [automated runs of attack simulation](/graph/api/resources/simulationautomationrun) for a tenant.

### Teamwork and communications | Calls and online meetings
Support a user to participate in an [online meeting](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting) in the [role](/graph/api/resources/meetingparticipantinfo#onlinemeetingrole-values) of a coorganizer.

### Teamwork and communications | Messaging
Support an [Azure Communication Services user](/graph/api/resources/azureCommunicationServicesUserConversationMember) to participate in a [team](/graph/api/resources/team), [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel), or [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat).

### To-do tasks
Use a single POST operation to [attach a file](/graph/api/todotask-post-attachments) up to 3MB to a [to-do task](/graph/api/resources/todotask), or [create an upload session](/graph/api/taskfileattachment-createuploadsession) to iteratively upload portions of a file up to 25 MB total size to attach it to a task.

## February 2023: New in preview only

### Applications | Synchronization
When calling the [synchronization API](/graph/api/resources/synchronization-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), take advantage of more granular permissions designed for reading or writing synchronization data, by using the new permission, `Synchronization.Read.All`, instead of the higher privileged permission, `Directory.Read.All`, and `Synchronization.ReadWrite.All` instead of `Directory.Read.All`.

### Calendar
Request a lower privileged delegated or application permission, `Calendar.ReadBasic` or `Calendars.ReadBasic.All`, for most read operations for events in calendars, with or without a signed-in user present. These permissions allow an app to read events of all calendars, except for properties such as body, attachments, and extensions. For the exact list of operations that support these permissions, see the [February updates](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/changelog/?search=&from=2023-02-01&to=2023-02-28) for **Calendar**.

### Device and app management | Cloud PC
- Enable or disable single sign-on as part of a [Cloud PC provisioning policy](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcprovisioningpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and of the [tenant-wide organization settings for Cloud PC](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcorganizationsettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). When single sign-on is enabled, Windows 365 users can use single sign-on to authenticate to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with passwordless options (for example, FIDO keys) to access their Cloud PCs. 
- Organizations with frontline workers can provision Cloud PCs as a shared [type](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcprovisioningpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#cloudpcprovisioningtype-values) and subscribe to a [shared-use service plan](/graph/api/resources/cloudPcSharedUseServicePlan?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for Cloud PCs.
- Allow a customer to select from a list of [supported region groups](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcsupportedregion?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#cloudpcregiongroup-values) when provisioning a Cloud PC, so to put that Cloud PC in one of the regions belonging to that group based on resource status. 

### Device and app management | Device updates
Use the Windows Update for Business deployment service to manage Windows 11 feature updates and [driver updates](windowsupdates-manage-driver-update.md). When enrolled devices are scanned for updates, the deployment service identifies applicable, better drivers for each device. The service collects such driver information in a [catalog](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-catalog?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for [approval](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-contentapproval?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), and schedules approved [catalog content](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-catalogcontent?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for [deployment](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-deployment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Identity and access | Directory management
Debut of pronouns support for organizations - use [pronouns settings](/graph/api/resources/pronounsSettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to _programmatically_ [manage the support of pronouns in an organization](pronouns-configure-pronouns-availability.md). Find out about how _administrators_ can [enable or disable pronouns in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/turn-pronouns-on-or-off?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true), and the availability timeline for pronouns on profile cards on the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=pronouns).  

### Identity and access | Directory management
Use the [recommendation](/graph/api/resources/recommendation?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource as personalized and actionable insights to implement Azure Active Directory best practices. Recommendations help to ensure your tenant is in a secure and healthy state and maximize the value of the features available in Azure AD. For more information about how recommendations work in Azure AD for administrators, see [What are Azure Active Directory recommendations](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations).

### Identity and access | Governance
[List](/graph/api/workflow-list-executionscope?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) the users who are in the scope of the execution conditions of a [workflow](/graph/api/resources/identitygovernance-workflow?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Security | Attack simulation and training
- [Create](/graph/api/attacksimulationroot-post-simulation?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [delete](/graph/api/simulation-delete?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) an [attack simulation](/graph/api/resources/simulation?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) campaign for a tenant. Prior to this update, apps can only [get](/graph/api/simulation-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) information about an existing simulation campaign.
- [Get](/graph/api/payload-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) information about an attack simulation training. Get further [details](/graph/api/resources/payloaddetail?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) such as the content and coachmarks.

### Teamwork and communications | Calls and online meetings
Identify the reasons for shared content or video from an [online meeting](/graph/api/resources/onlineMeeting?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) [participant](/graph/api/resources/meetingparticipants?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) being [restricted](/graph/api/resources/onlineMeetingRestricted?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Teamwork and communications | Messaging
Support an [Azure Communication Services user](/graph/api/resources/azureCommunicationServicesUserConversationMember?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to participate in a [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), or [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
